# Visual Planner

This Ember app is intended as a generic front end for planning systems.
It can be bound to any RESTful backend. For each of the models, a visual form can be defined.

This application uses the Ember-ThreeJS addon. This addon project is not finished yet, so for the time being, the ThreeJS component is in the Visual Planner app.

## Prerequisites
